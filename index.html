                Save the State is a text-based â€œchoose-your-own-adventure" simulation game. Students role-play as policymakers in their designated region and are tasked with improving their policies and infrastructure to mitigate climate change impacts. This simulation serves as a training simulation to introduce undergraduate sociology students to data-informed policymaking practices to perform praxis. The effectiveness of players' policy decisions increases or decreases their populations' climate change resilience, quantified as a community resilience index (CRI). Players' decisions improve or impair their CRI through effective policy decisions and expert resource allocation, rectifying ineffective policies and politicians to mitigate climate change impacts. Policy decisions include political reform, socioeconomic, and environmental policy focusing on prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery.

              <p class="para">
                Players hail from one of four regions: Region A, Region B, Region C, and Region D. Given its geography, each region boasts a unique ecology and environment susceptible to specific climate change events. Players' policy decisions are specific to their respective geography and will examine how different environmental circumstances inform infrastructure investment.
